<h2 style="text-align:center;color:#A17536;font-family:arial;font-size:140%;">BIOGRAPHY</h2>

<p style="text-align:center;color:#CCCCCC;font-family:arial;font-size:100%;">Handling back-up vocals and half the guitar- and songwriting<br>

 in Dutch band Non-Divine since he was seventeen,<br>

Martin has a part of the international metal scene<br> 

for well over a decade. Non-Divine has supported bands<br>

 like Dio, Volbeat, Anthrax, Nevermore and After Forever,

<br> played on many festivals, and toured Europe<br>

with Flotsam & Jetsam and Izegrim.<br>

Its debut album was was rewarded CD of the month<br>

by the prestigious Aardschok magazine.<br> 

With Non-Divine on a break, Martin set his mind on treading new grounds.<br><br>

Sharing his girlfriend's deep love of bands like Naglfar and Dissection,<br> 

he set out to write some songs for her. Being a perfectionist,<br>

the dark project turned into something massive.<br> 

Dubbing this new spawn Lucifer's Cold Embrace,<br>

he took it upon himself to write all music and lyrics;<br> 

perform, produce, mix and master the five brand new songs,<br>

and unleash them world-wide...<br><br>

...And he did.<br><br> 

Brutalizing double bass, grinding vocals, apocalyptic strings<br>

and choirs fuse with Martin's keen sense of<br> 

melody and song-writing to form <br> 

a remarkable experience.<br> 

Ferociously brutal while hauntingly beautiful,<br>

Sovereign Heresy will dig itself<br>

into the listener's skull like an icicle.<br><br> 

Lucifer's Cold Embrace is here to stay.<br>
